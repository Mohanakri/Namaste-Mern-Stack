### 🧠 **Episode 5: Diving into the Node.js GitHub Repo**

**Prompt title:** *How Node.js Internally Handles require() and Modules*
**Prompt summary:**
Describe how Node.js wraps modules using IIFEs, manages scope, exposes `module.exports`, and caches modules for performance. Then explore how Node.js integrates V8 and libuv inside its GitHub repository, including where `require()` and `setTimeout` are defined.

---

### ⚡ **Episode 6: libuv and Asynchronous I/O**

**Prompt title:** *Understanding Event Loop, Threads, and libuv in Node.js*
**Prompt summary:**
Explain how Node.js achieves asynchronous, non-blocking I/O using libuv. Describe the difference between synchronous and asynchronous execution, how the JS engine executes code (call stack, memory heap, GEC), and how libuv handles API, file, and timer operations.

---

### 🔁 **Episode 7: Synchronous vs Asynchronous Code**

**Prompt title:** *Synchronous, Asynchronous, and setTimeout(0) Behavior in Node.js*
**Prompt summary:**
Show how blocking methods (`fs.readFileSync`, `crypto.pbkdf2Sync`) affect performance. Contrast them with async versions. Explain `setTimeout(0)` behavior, event queue, and why callbacks execute only after the call stack is empty.

### 🔄 **Episode 9: libuv & Event Loop**

**Prompt title:** *Mastering the Event Loop and Callback Handling in Node.js*
**Prompt summary:**
Explain how **libuv** manages asynchronous tasks in Node.js using the **event loop**, **callback queues**, and **thread pool**. Describe the four main phases — Timers, Poll, Check, and Close Callbacks — and how **process.nextTick()** and **Promises** are prioritized as microtasks. Include examples comparing outputs of `setTimeout`, `setImmediate`, and file I/O callbacks to demonstrate execution order.

---

### 🧵 **Episode 10: Thread Pool in libuv**

**Prompt title:** *Understanding Thread Pools and Parallelism in Node.js*
**Prompt summary:**
Explain how **libuv’s thread pool** executes blocking operations (e.g., file system, DNS, crypto). Discuss the default thread pool size (`UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE = 4`), how to scale it, and when Node.js behaves as single- vs multi-threaded. Describe how **epoll/kqueue** mechanisms help handle thousands of network connections efficiently and introduce concepts like **Event Emitters**, **Streams**, **Buffers**, and **Pipes** in Node.js.

---

### 🌐 **Episode 11: Creating a Server**

**Prompt title:** *Building and Understanding Servers with Node.js*

Differentiate between **hardware** and **software** servers. Explain **client–server communication**, **sockets**, and **protocols** (HTTP, TCP/IP, DNS). Show how requests are mapped using **IP addresses, ports, and paths**. Introduce **distributed architectures** with frontend, backend, database, and media servers. Finally, demonstrate creating an **HTTP server** in Node.js using **Express**, and explain the difference between **Sockets** and **WebSockets**.

---

### 🗃️ **Episode 12: Databases — SQL & NoSQL**

**Prompt title:** *Comparing Relational and NoSQL Databases*

Compare **Monolithic** vs **Microservice** architectures in terms of scalability, deployment, codebase management, team structure, and debugging. Describe how big companies like Uber use microservices to separate modules (e.g., authentication, notifications). Cover SDLC models (Waterfall) and trade-offs:

* Monolith = simpler start, harder scaling.
* Microservices = independent teams and deployments but higher infrastructure cost.
  End by explaining which model fits DevTinder (best as two microservices – frontend and backend).

Outline tech stack: **Node.js, Express, MongoDB (backend)** + **React (frontend)**.
Cover **HLD vs LLD** steps:

* HLD → overall system architecture.
* LLD → DB design & API design.
  Design MongoDB collections (`user`, `connectionRequest`), relationship structure, and REST API endpoints (/signup, /login, /profile, /sendRequest, /reviewRequest, /connections).
  Clarify HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and CRUD operations.

---

### ⚙️ **Episode 03 – Creating Our Express Server**

**Prompt title:** *Setting Up Express Server for DevTinder*
