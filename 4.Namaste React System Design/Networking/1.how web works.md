### 🧩 Prompt:

> **Explain step-by-step how the web works** — from typing a website URL to seeing the page — including DNS lookup, TCP/SSL handshake, HTTP request/response, caching (service workers), browser connection limits, CDN hosting near ISPs, and file size impact on performance.
> Also describe ICANN, Whois, and how regional CDNs like Google reduce latency.
> Present it clearly with technical flow and optional diagram showing browser → cache → DNS → ISP → CDN → server.

Would you like me to turn this into a **“React-friendly” educational prompt** (for use inside a project, e.g. as interactive content or code comments)?
