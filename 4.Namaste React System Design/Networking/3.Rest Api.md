Here’s your ready-to-use **prompt** version — clear, reusable, and perfectly structured for AI, documentation, or study notes 👇

### 🧩 **Prompt: REST API — Full Concept Explanation**

> Explain **REST API** clearly — include an overview, key benefits (ease of use, stateless, scalability, flexibility, uniform interface, caching, separation of concerns, interoperability, ease of testing, and security).
>
> Describe all **building blocks** — URL, methods, headers, request, response, and status codes.
>
> Show how an **HTTP request structure** looks (with example) and what parts it contains — request line, headers, and body — and mention which parts actually go from client to server.
>
> Show how an **HTTP response structure** looks (with example) and what rules it follows — including status line, headers, and body.
>
> Explain **URL path structure** with examples (base URL, resource path, subresource, query parameters), and clarify that **fragment identifiers (#)** do **not go from client to server**.
>
> Finally, include a short **flow diagram** of how data travels between client and server (request → response) and a brief table of **common HTTP status codes**.

Would you like me to add a **diagram-style visual prompt** (for AI image generation or classroom slide use) showing this client–server request flow?
