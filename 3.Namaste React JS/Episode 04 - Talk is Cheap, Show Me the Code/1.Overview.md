## Namaste React Course by Akshay Saini
# Chapter 04 - Talk is Cheap, show me the code


## Theory Assignment:
- Is `JSX` mandatory for React?
- Is `ES6` mandatory for React?
- `{TitleComponent}` vs `{<TitleComponent/>}` vs `{<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>}` in `JSX`.
- How can I write `comments` in JSX?
- What is `<React.Fragment></React.Fragment>` and `<></>`?
- What is `Reconciliation` in React?
- What is `React Fiber`?
- Why do we need `keys` in React?
- Can we use `index as keys` in React?
- What is `props in React`? Ways to.
- What is `Config Driven UI`?


## Coding Assignment:
- Build a `Food Ordering App`
    - Think of a `cool name` for your app
    - Build an `AppLayout`
    - Build a `Header Component` with `Logo` & `Nav Items` & `Cart`
    - Build a `Body Component`
        - Build `RestaurantList Component`
        - Build `RestaurantCard Component`
            - Use `static data initially`
            - Make your `card dynamic`(pass in props)
                - `Props` - passing arguments to a function - `Use Destructuring` & `Spread operator`
            - `Render` your cards with `dynamic data of restaurants`
            - Use `Array.map` to render all the restaurants

### PS. Basically do everything that I did in the class, in the `same sequence`. `Don't skip small things`.
